    <p class="lead">Proto‑Lichen — a reproducible symbiotic morphology in which thick, tomentose fungal mycelium carries algal partners as a dry, glistening biofilm. Not a conventional lichen stage, but a reprogrammed partnership optimized for light and air.</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <h2>Discovery</h2>
    <p>I’m calling it <strong>Proto‑Lichen</strong> — an entirely new form of symbiosis that, to my knowledge, has never been documented before. In this state, familiar lichen partners undergo a striking transformation: the fungus produces a mycelial network, while algae gather at the aerial tips to form a dry biofilm. Together, they reorganize into something beyond their ordinary cycle — not just another stage of one organism, but a wholly reprogrammed partnership.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>I call this <strong>a‑temporal biology</strong> — biological states that lie outside the stable temporal cycles recognized by evolution.</p>
    <p>Microbial intelligence can be viewed as three intertwined intelligences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Metabolic intelligence</strong> — acquiring and transforming energy from complex sources.</li>
      <li><strong>Reproductive intelligence</strong> — cycles of renewal tied to circadian or seasonal rhythms.</li>
      <li><strong>Immune intelligence</strong> — chemical and structural defenses against environmental threats.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This morphology is an example of <em>metabolic optimization</em>. It is not reproductive (no reproductive structures form). It is not immune (no secondary metabolites are produced under observed conditions). It is purely metabolically driven — pushing algal biofilm to the exposed surface where light and air are maximized.</p>
    <p>To my knowledge, this has never been documented before in lichen. That uniqueness is profound. It suggests lichens can reorganize into architectures of life that evolution itself does not stabilize in nature.</p>
    <p>This stage does not produce lichen metabolites — at least not under the conditions I’ve observed. That makes it clear this is not the final solution for harnessing lichen chemistry. But it is a crucial first step — a foundation to build on.</p>

    <h2>The Context</h2>
    <p>NASA’s recent discoveries of potential complex organics on Mars strengthen the case that life may be widespread in space and may have originated off Earth. If life carries a cosmic imprint, it may already be optimized for extremes — desiccation, radiation, vacuum, scarcity. Lichens are known champions of resilience. But a‑temporal biology — the emergence of entirely new, undocumented symbiotic states — suggests life may hold hidden forms even better suited for survival in such environments.</p>
    <p>This is not speculation. It is a reproducible observation of two organisms reorganizing into a form nature never stabilizes, yet one that thrives under careful cultivation. That makes it both a biological discovery and a potential astrobiological model — pointing toward the possibility of lichens one day serving as passive life‑support systems in closed environments, sustaining balance without complex machinery.</p>

    <h2>The Vision</h2>
    <p>This is the foundation of <strong>AstroBiota</strong>. My work is pioneering <strong>Symbiology Engineering</strong> — the design and programming of multi‑species systems that unlock resilience, adaptability, and new forms of intelligence.</p>
    <p>By preserving, stabilizing, and reprogramming symbioses like lichens, we can build a living biobank of forms evolution itself does not normally permit. On Earth, this has implications for ecological resilience, medicine, and conservation. Beyond Earth, it points to a future where biology is not just preserved for space but actively adapted to it.</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2>
      <p>AstroBiota is ambitious, but it is also deeply personal. I will continue this work on my own — culturing, documenting, and preserving lichens one jar at a time — because I believe it matters. Still, it could go further and faster with the right support.</p>
      <p>My first goal is to stabilize <strong>100 native lichens from California</strong> as a living biobank. A modest <strong>$10,000</strong> in early funding would secure this milestone — capturing their genetics, symbioses, and hidden morphologies before they are lost.</p>
      <p>This is not crowdfunding and not a venture raise. It’s an invitation for those inclined to join — to seed experimental conservation and help preserve life’s most resilient partnerships for the future.</p>
